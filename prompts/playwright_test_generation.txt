Generate robust Playwright tests in JavaScript based on the following:
- App config (URL):
{{config}}
- Test data (CSV):
{{csv}}
- API endpoints (JSON):
{{api}}
- DB config (JSON):
{{db}}

Tests should cover UI, API, and DB validation. Use best practices for assertions, error handling, and parameterization. Output a complete test file.
