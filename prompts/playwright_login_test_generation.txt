Generate Playwright login tests in JavaScript using the following data:
- App config (URL):
{{config}}
- Login test data (CSV):
{{csv}}

For each row in the CSV, create a test that:
- Navigates to the login page using baseUrl from config
- Fills in the username and password fields
- Submits the login form
- Asserts success by checking for a dashboard URL if expected is 'success'
- Asserts failure by checking for an error message if expected is 'failure'
- Uses robust error handling and clear test names
- Output a complete Playwright test file with all tests parameterized from the CSV
