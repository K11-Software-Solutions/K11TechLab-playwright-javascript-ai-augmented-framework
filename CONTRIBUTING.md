# Contributing to K11TechLab – AI-Augmented Playwright JavaScript Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.  
This repository is a **learning and experimentation lab** focused on modern Playwright automation and responsible AI-augmented test engineering.

Contributions from engineers, researchers, and practitioners are welcome.

---

## Project Philosophy

This framework is built on three core principles:

1. **Strong automation fundamentals first**  
   AI augments Playwright mastery—it does not replace engineering discipline.

2. **Human-in-the-loop AI usage**  
   All AI-generated outputs are treated as suggestions and must be reviewed, validated, and owned by engineers.

3. **Responsible experimentation**  
   The project encourages learning and research while clearly distinguishing experimental features from stable examples.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

You may open an issue to:
- Report bugs or unexpected behavior  
- Suggest improvements to Playwright patterns or framework structure  
- Propose enhancements to AI-assisted workflows or prompt templates  
- Request new demo scenarios or learning examples  

Please include:
- Clear steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Environment details (Node version, Playwright version, OS)  
- Expected vs actual behavior  

---

### 2. Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome for:

- New Playwright E2E, component, or API demo tests  
- Improvements to configuration-driven or data-driven patterns  
- Enhancements or additions to AI prompt templates  
- Documentation improvements (README, diagrams, guides)  
- Refactoring for clarity, maintainability, or consistency  

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and scoped to a single concern  
- Clearly document **what changed and why**  
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files  
- Label experimental or research-only changes explicitly  
- Ensure generated files are intentional and reviewed

### 3. Experimental & Research Contributions

This project explicitly supports **research-oriented experimentation**, including:

- Alternative prompt strategies or prompt chaining  
- Multi-step AI-assisted workflows  
- Evaluation of AI-generated test quality  
- Extensions to additional AI providers or models  
- Observability, validation, or coverage analysis experiments  

If your contribution is experimental:
- Clearly label it as such in code comments or documentation  
- Avoid mixing experimental features into core demo paths  
- Document assumptions, limitations, and findings

## Responsible AI Usage Expectations

By contributing to this project, you agree to the following:

- AI-generated tests are **not authoritative** and must be reviewed  
- No autonomous execution or decision-making is introduced  
- Generated outputs remain readable, auditable Playwright JavaScript  
- Secrets and credentials are managed securely via `.env` files  
- Production usage requires independent validation and governance  

---

## Code Style & Quality

- Follow existing Playwright and JavaScript conventions used in the repo  
- Prefer clarity and readability over clever abstractions  
- Keep examples instructional and real-world oriented  
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies

## Licensing & Attribution

By submitting a contribution, you agree that your work may be included under the repository’s existing license.

If you reference this project in academic or research work, please use the suggested citation provided in the repository documentation.

## Final Note

This repository is intended to be a **safe, thoughtful space** for exploring the intersection of Playwright automation and AI-assisted testing.

Curiosity, rigor, and responsibility are valued more than speed.

Thank you for contributing.
